## Hey! Thanks for forking my repo! I messed up though... I used `git filter-branch` to edit some previous commits. As a result the forks have a completely different history. So before you make any changes, you should delete this fork and re-fork again. Again, sorry :(<br><br>-aheze

### About
**For the writers and bloggers out there:**

Tutorials with only words are boring, so we add images. And if they need to be more detailed, we add video... but video isn't always the best choice.
- Readers may not want to turn on audio.
- If they're on their phone, the video will open in a full-screen modal. That disrupts the reading experience.
- Some blogging sites don't allow video embeds

That's why we use gifs instead! (Yes, gifs are memory-inefficient, but they're really convenient... and ProgressGif has options for framerate.)

ProgressGif is an iOS app made with Swift 5 and UIKit, inspired by this [article](https://www.excelcampus.com/tips-shortcuts/add-progress-bar-to-gif/). SwiftUI would have be fine for building the UI, but because there's a lot of under-the-hood work with video rendering, I thought it would be better to just go with UIKit.
